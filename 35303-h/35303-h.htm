<p>
<i>Mo.</i> &nbsp; God give 'em joy.<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; Amen.<br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; Amen, say I too:<br />
The pudding's now i'th' proof, alas poor wench.<br />
Through what a mine of patience must thou work,<br />
E'r thou know'st good hour more!<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis too true: Certain,<br />
Methinks her father has dealt harshly with her,<br />
Exceeding harshly, and not like a Father,<br />
To match her to this Dragon; I protest<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
I pity the poor Gentlewoman.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; Methinks now,<br />
He's not so terrible as people think him.<br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; This old thief flatters, out of meer devotion,<br />
To please the Father for his second daughter.<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; But shall he have her?<br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; Yes, when I have <i>Rome</i>.<br />
And yet the father's for him.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; I'll assure ye,<br />
I hold him a good man.<br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; Yes sure a wealthy,<br />
But whether a good womans man, is doubtful.<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; Would 'twere no worse.<br />
<br />
<a name="p3_13" id="p3_13" class="fc"><i>M</i>[<i>o</i>]<i>r.</i></a> &nbsp; What though his other wife,<br />
Out of her most abundant soberness,<br />
Out of her daily hue and cries upon him,<br />
(For sure she was a rebel) turn'd his temper,<br />
And forc'd him blow as high as she? dos't follow<br />
He must retain that long since buried Tempest,<br />
To this soft Maid?<br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; I fear it.<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; So do I too:<br />
And so far, that if God had made me woman,<br />
And his wife that must be&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; What would you do, Sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; I would learn to eat coals with an angry Cat,<br />
And spit fire at him: I would (to prevent him)<br />
Do all the ramping, roaring tricks, a whore<br />
Being drunk, and tumbling ripe, would tremble at:<br />
There is no safety else, nor moral wisdom.<br />
To be a wife, and his.<br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; So I should think too.<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; For yet the bare remembrance of his first wife<br />
(I tell ye on my knowledge, and a truth too)<br />
Will make him start in's sleep, and very often<br />
Cry out for Cudgels, Colestaves, any thing;<br />
Hiding his <a name="p3_36" id="p3_36" class="fc">breeches, out of fear</a> her Ghost<br />
Should walk, and wear 'em yet. Since his first marriage,<br />
He is no more the still <i>Petruchio</i>,<br />
Than I am <i>Babylon</i>.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; He's a good fellow,<br />
And on my word I love him: but to think<br />
A fit match for this tender soul&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; His very frown, if she but say her prayers<br />
Louder than men talk treason, makes him tinder;<br />
The motion of a Dial, when he's testy,<br />
Is the same trouble to him as a Water-work;<br />
She must do nothing of her self; not eat,<br />
Drink, say Sir, how do ye? make her ready, unready,<br />
Unless he bid her.<br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; He will bury her,<br />
Ten pound to twenty shillings, within these three weeks.<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; I'll be your half.<br />
</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Jaques <i>with a pot of Wine.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; He loves her most extreamly,<br />
And so long 'twill be Honey-moon. Now <i>Jaques</i>.<br />
You are a busie man I am sure.<br />
<br />
<i>Jaq.</i> &nbsp; Yes certain,<br />
This old sport must have eggs.<br />
<br />
<i>Sop.</i> &nbsp; Not yet this ten daies.<br />
<br />
<i>Jaq.</i> &nbsp; Sweet Gentlemen with Muskadel.<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; That's right, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; This fellow broods his Master: speed ye <i>Jaques</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; We shall be for you presently.<br />
<br />
<i>Jaq.</i> &nbsp; Your worships<br />
Shall have it rich and neat: and o' my conscience<br />
As welcome as our <i>Lady-day</i>: Oh my old Sir,<br />
When shall we see your worship run at Ring?<br />
That hour, a standing were worth money.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; So Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Jaq.</i> &nbsp; Upon my little honesty, your Mistriss,<br />
If I have any speculation, must think<br />
This single thrumming of a Fiddle,<br />
Without a Bow, but even poor sport.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; Y'are merry.<br />
<br />
<i>Ja.</i> &nbsp; Would I were wise too: so God bless your worship.<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; The fellow tells you true.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Exit</i> Jaq.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; When is the day man?<br />
Come, come, you'll steal a marriage.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; Nay, believe me:<br />
But when her Father pleases, I am ready,<br />
And all my friends shall know it.<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; Why not now?<br />
One charge had serv'd for both.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; There's reason in't.<br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; Call'd <i>Rowland</i>&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; Will ye walk?<br />
They'll think we are lost: Come Gentlemen.<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; You have wip'd him now.<br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; So will he never the wench, I hope.<br />
<br />
<i>Tra.</i> &nbsp; I wish it.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span><br />

<h3><i>Sc&aelig;na Secunda.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Rowland <i>and</i> Livia.</p>

<p>
<i>Row.</i> &nbsp; Now <i>Livia</i>, if you'll go away to night,<br />
If your affections be not made of words.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; I love you, and you know how dearly <i>Rowland</i>,<br />
Is there none near us? my affections ever<br />
Have been your servants; with what superstition<br />
I have ever Sainted you&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Row.</i> &nbsp; Why then take this way.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; 'Twill be a childish, and a less prosperous course,<br />
Than his that knows not care: why should we do,<br />
Our honest and our hearty love such wrong,<br />
To over-run our fortunes?<br />
<br />
<i>Row.</i> &nbsp; Then you flatter.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Alas, you know I cannot.<br />
<br />
<a name="p5_27" id="p5_27" class="fc"><i>Ro</i>[<i>w</i>].</a> &nbsp; What hope's left else<br />
But flying to enjoy ye?<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; None so far,<br />
For let it be admitted, we have time,<br />
And all things now in other expectation,<br />
My father's bent against us; what but ruine,<br />
Can such a by-way bring us? if your fears<br />
Would let you look with my eyes, I would shew you,<br />
And certain, how our staying here would win us<br />
A course, though somewhat longer, yet far surer.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<i>Row.</i> &nbsp; And then <i>Moroso</i> h'as ye.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; No such matter<br />
For hold this certain, begging, stealing, whoring,<br />
Selling (which is a sin unpardonable)<br />
Of counterfeit Cods, or musty English <i>Croacus</i>;<br />
Switches, or Stones for th' tooth-ache sooner finds me,<br />
Than that drawn <a name="p6_6" id="p6_6" class="fc">Fox <i>Moroso</i></a>.<br />
<br />
<i>Row.</i> &nbsp; But his money,<br />
If wealth may win you&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; If a Hog may be<br />
High Priest among the <i>Jews</i>? his money <i>Rowland</i>?<br />
Oh Love forgive me, what faith hast thou?<br />
Why, can his money kiss me?<br />
<br />
<i>Row.</i> &nbsp; Yes.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Behind,<br />
Laid out upon a Petticoat: or graspe me<br />
While I cry, Oh good thank you? o'my troth<br />
Thou mak'st me merry with thy fear: or lie with me.<br />
As you may do? alas, what fools you men are?<br />
His mouldy money? half a dozen Riders,<br />
That cannot sit, but stampt fast to their Saddles?<br />
No <i>Rowland</i>, no man shall make use of me;<br />
My beauty was born free, and free I'll give it<br />
To him that loves, not buys me. You yet doubt me.<br />
<br />
<i>Row.</i> &nbsp; I cannot say I doubt ye.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Goe thy ways,<br />
Thou art the prettiest puling piece of passion:<br />
Y'faith I will not fail thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Row.</i> &nbsp; I had rather&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Prethee believe me, if I do not carry it,<br />
For both our goods&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Row.</i> &nbsp; But&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; What but?<br />
<br />
<i>Row.</i> &nbsp; I would tell you.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; I know all you can tell me; all's but this,<br />
You would have me, and lie with me; is't not so?<br />
<br />
<i>Row.</i> &nbsp; Yes.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Why you shall; will that content you? Goe.<br />
<br />

Thou art an honest fellow: here's my Sister;<br />

E'r I am three nights older, I am for thee:<br />
You shall hear what I do.<br />

It would ev'n hang it self, should I but cross it.<br />
For pure love to the matter I must hatch it.<br />
<br />
<i>Bya.</i> &nbsp; Nay, never look for merry hour, <i>Maria</i>,<br />
If now you make it not; let not your blushes,<br />
Your modesty, and tenderness of spirit,<br />
Make you continual Anvile to his anger:<br />
Believe me, since his first wife set him going,<br />
Nothing can bind his rage: Take your own council,<br />
You shall not say that I perswaded you.<br />
But if you suffer him&mdash;<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Bya.</i> &nbsp; Have you a stomach to't?<br />

Like <i>Curtius</i>, to redeem my Countrey, <a name="p7_26" id="p7_26" class="fc">I have</a><br />

Farewel all poorer thoughts, but spight and anger,<br />
Till I have wrought a miracle. Now cosin,<br />
I am no more the gentle, tame <i>Maria</i>;<br />
Mistake me not; I have a new soul in me<br />
Made of a North wind, nothing but tempest;<br />
And like a tempest shall it make all ruin,<br />
Till I have run my Will out.<br />

<i>Bya.</i> &nbsp; This is brave now,<br />

When <i>Paphos</i> Revels should <a name="p8_5" id="p8_5" class="fc">rowze up</a> old night,<br />
To sweat against a Cork; to lie and tell<br />
The clock <a name="p8_7" id="p8_7" class="fc">o'th lungs</a>, to rise sport starv'd?<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Dear Sister,<br />
Where have you been, you talk thus?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; Why at Church, wench;<br />
Where I am ti'd to talke thus: I am a wife now.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; It seems so, and a modest.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; You are an ass;<br />
When thou art married once, thy modesty<br />
Will never buy thee pins.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; 'Bless me.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; From what?<br />
<br />
<i>Bya.</i> &nbsp; From such a tame fool as our cosin <i>Livia</i>?<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; You are not mad.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; Yes wench, and so must you be,<br />
Or none of our acquaintance: mark me <i>Livia</i>;<br />
Or indeed fit for our sex: 'Tis bed time.<br />
Pardon me yellow <i>Hymen</i>, that I mean<br />
Thine offerings to protract, or to keep fasting<br />
My valiant Bridegroom.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Whither will this woman?<br />
<br />
<i>Bya.</i> &nbsp; You may perceive her end.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Or rather fear it.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; Dare you be partner in't?<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Leave it <i>Maria</i>,<br />
I fear I have mark'd too much, for goodness leave it;<br />
Divest you with obedient hands, to bed.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; To bed? no <i>Livia</i>, there are Comets hang<br />
Prodigious over that yet; there's a fellow<br />
Must yet before I know that heat (ne'r start wench)<br />
Be made a man, for yet he is a monster;<br />
Here must his head be <i>Livia</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Never hope it.<br />
'Tis as easie with a Sive to scoop the Ocean, as<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>To tame <i>Petruchio</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; Stay: <i>Lucina</i> hear me,<br />
Never unlock the treasure of my womb<br />
For humane fruit, to make it capable;<br />
Nor never with thy secret hand make brief<br />
A mothers labor to me; if I do<br />
Give way unto my married Husband's Will,<br />
Or be a Wife in any thing but hopes,<br />
Till I have made him easie as a child,<br />
And tame as fear, he shall not win a smile,<br />
Or a pleas'd look, from this austerity,<br />
Though it would pull another Joynture from him,<br />
And make him ev'ry day another man;<br />
And when I kiss him, till I have my Will,<br />
May I be barren of delights, and know<br />
Only what pleasures are in dreams, and guesses.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; A strange <i>Exordium</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Bya.</i> &nbsp; All the several wrongs<br />
Done by Imperious Husbands to their Wives<br />
These thousand years and upwards, strengthen thee:<br />
Thou hast a brave cause.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; And I'll do it bravely,<br />
Or may I knit my life out ever after.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; In what part of the world got she this spirit?<br />
Yet pray <i>Maria</i>, look before you truly,<br />
Besides the obedience of a wife;<br />
Which you will find a heavy imputation,<br />
Which yet I cannot think your own, it shews<br />
So distant from your sweetness.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis I swear.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Weigh but the person, and the hopes you have,<br />
To work this desperate cure.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; A weaker subject<br />
Would shame the end I aim at, disobedience.<br />
You talk too tamely: By the faith I have<br />
In mine own noble Will, that childish woman<br />
That lives a prisoner to her Husbands pleasure,<br />
Has lost her making, and becomes a beast,<br />
Created for his use, not fellowship.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; His first wife said as much.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; She was a fool,<br />
And took a scurvy course; let her be nam'd<br />
'Mongst those that wish for things, but dare not do'em:<br />
I have a new dance for him.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Are you of this faith?<br />
<br />
<i>Bya.</i> &nbsp; Yes truly, and will die in't.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Why then let's all wear breeches.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; Now thou com'st near the nature of a woman;<br />
Hang these tame hearted Eyasses, that no sooner<br />
See the Lure out, and hear their Husbands hollow,<br />
But cry like Kites upon 'em: The free Haggard<br />
(Which is that woman, that hath wing, and knows it,<br />
Spirit and plume) will make an hundred checks,<br />
To shew her freedom, sail in ev'ry air,<br />
And look out ev'ry pleasure; not regarding<br />
Lure, nor quarry, till her pitch command<br />
What she desires, making her foundred keeper<br />
Be glad to fling out trains, and golden ones,<br />
To take her down again.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; You are learned, Sister;<br />
Yet I say still take heed.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; A witty saying;<br />
I'll tell thee <i>Livia</i>, had this fellow tired<br />
As many wives as horses under him,<br />
With spurring of their patience; had he got<br />
A Patent, with an Office to reclaim us,<br />
Confirm'd by Parliament; had he all the malice<br />
And subtilty of Devils, or of us,<br />
Or any thing that's worse than both.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Hey, hey boys, this is excellent.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; Or could he<br />
Cast his wives new again, like Bels, to make 'em<br />
Sound to his Will; or had the fearful name<br />
Of the first breaker of wild women: yet,<br />
Yet would I undertake this man, thus single,<br />
And, spight of all the freedom he has reach'd to,<br />
Turn him and bend him as I list, and mold him<br />
Into a babe again; that aged women,<br />
<a name="p10_38" id="p10_38" class="fc">W[a]nting</a> both teeth and spleen, may Master him.<br />

<i>Bya.</i> &nbsp; Thou wilt be chronicl'd.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; That's all I aim at.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; I must confess, I do with all my heart<br />
Hate an imperious Husband, and in time<br />
Might be so wrought upon.<br />
<br />
<i>Bya.</i> &nbsp; To make him cuckold?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; If he deserve it.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Then I'll leave ye Ladies.<br />
<br />
<i>Bya.</i> &nbsp; Thou hast not so much noble anger in thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; Go sleep, go sleep, what we intend to do,<br />
Lies not for such starv'd souls, as thou hast <i>Livia</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; Good night: the Bridegroom will be with you presently.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; That's more than you know.<br />
<br />
<i>Liv.</i> &nbsp; If ye work upon him,<br />
As you have promised, ye may give example,<br />
Which no doubt will be followed.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; So.<br />
<br />

Confess your self; bring not a sin so hainous<br />

If thou be'st double, and betray'st our honors,<br />

There is no women living, nor no hope<br />

No teeth, nor eyes, nor legs, but wooden ones<br />
Come but i'th' wind-ward of thee, for sure she'll smell thee;<br />
Thou'lt be so rank, she'll ride thee like a night-Mare,<br />
And say her Prayers back-ward to undo thee:<br />
She'll curse thy meat and drink, and when thou marriest,<br />
Clap a sound spell for ever on thy pleasures.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; Children of five year old, like little Fairies,<br />

Will (like so many furies) shake their keys;<br />

Crying revenge: take heed, 'tis hideous:<br />
Oh 'tis a fearful office, if thou hadst<br />
(Though thou be'st perfect now) when thou cam'st hither,<br />
A false imagination, get thee gone,<br />

In way of duty, but of love, and Credit;<br />
All I expect is but a noble care<br />
Of what I have brought you, and of what I am,<br />

<p>
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; That I do love her, is without all question,<br />
And most extremely, dearly, most exactly;<br />
And that I would ev'n now, this present Monday,<br />
Before all others, Maids, Wives, Women, Widows,<br />
Of what degree or calling, Marry her,<br />
As certain too; but to be made a Whim-wham,<br />
A Jib-crack, and a Gentleman o'th first house<br />
For all my kindness to her.<br />
<br />
<i>Petron.</i> &nbsp; How you take it?<br />
Thou get a Wench, thou <a name="p57_33" id="p57_33" class="fc">get a dozen</a> night-caps?<br />
Wouldst have her come, and lick thee like a Calfe,<br />
And blow thy nose, and buss thee?<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; Not so neither.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<i>Petron.</i> &nbsp; What wouldst thou have her do?<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; Do as she <a name="p58_1" id="p58_1" class="fc">[sh]ould</a> do;<br />
Put on a clean Smock, and to Church, and Marry,<br />
And then to Bed a Gods name, this is fair play,<br />
And keeps the Kings peace, let her leave her bobs,<br />
I have had too many of them, and her quillets,<br />
She is as nimble that way as an <a name="p58_6" id="p58_6" class="fc">Ee[le]</a>;<br />
But in the way she ought to me especially,<br />
A sow of Lead is swifter.<br />
<br />
<i>Petron.</i> &nbsp; Quoat your griefs down.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; Give fair quarter, I am old and crasie,<br />
And subject to much fumbling, I confess it;<br />
Yet something I would have that's warme, to hatch me:<br />
But understand me I would have it so,<br />
I buy not more repentance in the bargain<br />
Than the ware's worth I have; if you allow me<br />
Worthy your Son-in-Law, and your allowance,<br />
Do it a way of credit; let me show so,<br />
And not be troubled in my visitations,<br />
With blows, and bitterness, and down-right railings,<br />
As if we were to couple like two Cats,<br />
With clawing, and loud clamour:<br />
<br />
<i>Petron.</i> &nbsp; Thou fond Man.<br />
Hast thou forgot the Ballad, crabbed age,<br />
Can <i>May</i> and <i>January</i> match together,<br />
And nev'r a storm between 'em? say she abuse thee,<br />
Put case she doe.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; Well.<br />
<br />
<i>Petron.</i> &nbsp; Nay, believe she do's.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; I do believe she do's.<br />
<br />
<i>Petron.</i> &nbsp; And div'lishly:<br />
Art thou a whit the worse?<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; That's not the matter,<br />
I know, being old, tis fit I am abus'd;<br />
I know 'tis hansome, and I know moreover<br />
I am to love her for't.<br />
<br />
<i>Petron.</i> &nbsp; Now you come to me.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; Nay more than this; I find too, and find certain,<br />
What Gold I have, Pearle, Bracelets, Rings, or Owches,<br />
Or what she can desire, Gowns, Petticotes,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>Wastcotes, Embroydered-stockings, Scarffs, Cals, Feathers,<br />
Hats, five pound Garters, Muffs, Masks, Ruffs, and Ribands,<br />
I am to give her for't.<br />
<br />
<i>Petron.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis right, you are so.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; But when I have done all this, and think it duty,<br />
Is't requisit an other bore my nostrils?<br />
Riddle me that.<br />
<br />
<i>Petron.</i> &nbsp; Go get you gone, and dreame<br />
She's thine within these two dayes, for she is so;<br />
The Boy's beside the saddle: get warm broths,<br />
And feed a pace; think not of worldly business,<br />
It cools the blood; leave off your tricks, they are hateful,<br />
And meere fore-runners of the ancient measures;<br />
Contrive your beard o'th top cut like <i>Verdugoes</i>;<br />
It shows you would be wise, and burn your night-cap,<br />
It looks like half a winding-sheet, and urges<br />
From a young Wench nothing but cold repentance:<br />
You may eate Onyons, so you'l not be lavish.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; I am glad of that.<br />
<br />
<i>Petron.</i> &nbsp; They purge the blood, and quicken,<br />
But after 'em, conceive me, sweep your mouth,<br />
And where there wants a tooth, stick in a clove.<br />
<br />
<i>Mor.</i> &nbsp; Shall I hope once again, say't.<br />

Not that the thing was done (conceive me rightly)<br />
Do's any way molest me.<br />

<i>Petro.</i> &nbsp; What then Lady?<br />
<br />
<i>By.</i> &nbsp; But that I was not in't, there's my sorrow, there<br />
Now you understand me, for I'll tell you,<br />
It was so sound a piece, and so well carried,<br />
And if you mark the way, so hansomely,<br />
Of such a heighth, and excellence, and art<br />
I have not known a braver; for conceive me,<br />
When the gross fool her Husband would be sick&mdash;<br />

And like an excellent cunning Woman, cur'd me<br />
One madness with another, which was rare,<br />

There was not to be thought a way to save her<br />
In all imagination, beside this.<br />

In sending, who knowes whether, all the plate,<br />

By a great providence, and my friends assistance<br />
Which he will thank me one day for: alas,<br />
I could have watch'd as well as they, have serv'd him<br />
In any use, better, and willinger.<br />
The Law commands me to do it, love commands me,<br />
And my own duty charges me.<br />

If I were worse, I were better; That you are well,<br />
At least, that you appear so, I thank Heaven,<br />
Long may it hold, and that you are here, I am glad too;<br />
But that you have abus'd me wretchedly,<br />
And such a way that shames the name of Husband,<br />
Such a malicious mangy way, so mingled,<br />
(Never look strangely on me, I dare tell you)<br />
With breach of honesty, care, kindness, manners.<br />
<br />
<i>Petru.</i> &nbsp; Holla, you kick too fast.<br />
<br />

I am sure the lewdest; now be still, and mark me;<br />
Were I but any way addicted to the Devil,<br />
I should now think I had met a play-fellow<br />
To profit by, and that way the most learned<br />

I'll make you roare, before I leave.<br />

Thou Seminary of all sedition,<br />
Thou Sword of veng'ance, with a thred hung o're us,<br />
Was it not sin enough, and wickedness<br />
In full abundance? Was it not vexation<br />
At all points, <i>cap a pe</i>? nay, I shall pinch you,<br />
Thus like a rotten Rascal to abuse<br />
The name of Heaven, the tye of Marriage,<br />
The honour of thy Friends; the expectation<br />
Of all that thought thee virtuous, with Rebellion,<br />
Childish and base Rebellion, but continuing<br />
After forgiveness too, and worse, your mischief,<br />
And against him, setting the hope of Heaven by,<br />

Thou Idle thing of nothing, thou pull'd Primrose,<br />
That two hours after, art a Weed, and wither'd,<br />

Am I so blind and Bed-rid? I was mad,<br />
And had the Plague, and no Man must come near me,<br />
I must be shut up, and my substance bezel'd,<br />
And an old Woman watch me.<br />

Do'st thou not cry, come beat me?<br />

And my last loving tears farewell: the first stroke,<br />
The very first you give me, if you dare strike,<br />
Try me, and you shall find it so, for ever,<br />
Never to be recall'd: I know you love me,<br />
Mad till you have enjoy'd me; I do turne<br />
Utterly from you, and what Man I meet first<br />
That has but spirit to deserve a favour,<br />
Let him bear any shape, the worse the better.<br />
Shall kill you, and enjoy me; what I have said<br />
About your foolish sickness, e're you have me<br />
As you would have me, you shall swear, is certain,<br />

To gather wisdom? go, and go alone,<br />
Only your noble mind for your companion,<br />
And if a woman may win credit with you,<br />
Go far, too far you cannot: still the farther<br />
The more experience finds you: and go sparing,<br />
One meal a week will serve you, and one sute,<br />
Through all your travels: for you'll find it certain,<br />

'Tis very fair; get you aboard to night, Sir,<br />

Manly, and worthily, 'tis for my credit,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>And for those flying fames here of your follies,<br />
Your gambols, and ill breeding of your youth,<br />
For which I understand you take this travel,<br />

And the most large addition of your credit,<br />
That those shall die: if you want Limon-waters,<br />

I never was so boyish; well, what follows?<br />
<br />
<i>Petro.</i> &nbsp; She's mine now, as I please to settle her<br />
At my command, and where I please to plant her:<br />
Only she would take a kind of farewel of you,<br />

The memory of this man, had he liv'd<br />
But two years longer, had begot more follies,<br />
Than wealthy Autumn Flies. But let him rest,<br />
He was a fool, and farewel he; not pitied,<br />
I mean in way of life, or action<br />
By any understanding man that's honest;<br />
But only in's posterity, which I,<br />
Out of the fear his ruines might out-live him,<br />
In some bad issue, like a careful woman,<br />
Like one indeed, born only to preserve him,<br />
Deny'd him means to raise.<br />
<br />
<i>Petru.</i> &nbsp; Unbutton me,<br />
&mdash;I die indeed else! Oh <i>Maria</i>,<br />
Oh my unhappiness, my misery.<br />
<br />
<i>Petro.</i> &nbsp; Goe to him whore; &mdash;&mdash; if he perish,<br />
I'll see thee hang'd my self.<br />
<br />
<i>Petru.</i> &nbsp; Why, why <i>Maria</i>?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; I have done my worst, and have my end, forgive me;<br />
From this hour make me what you please: I have tam'd ye,<br />
And now am vow'd your servant: Look not strangely,<br />
Nor fear what I say to you. Dare you kiss me?<br />
Thus I begin my new love.<br />
<br />
<i>Petru.</i> &nbsp; Once again?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; With all my heart.<br />
<br />
<i>Petru.</i> &nbsp; Once again <i>Maria</i>,<br />
Oh Gentlemen, I know not where I am.<br />

<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; Get ye to bed then: there you'll quickly know Sir.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
<i>Petru.</i> &nbsp; Never no more your old tricks?<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; Never Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Petru.</i> &nbsp; You shall not need, for as I have a faith<br />
No cause shall give occasion.<br />
<br />
<i>Mar.</i> &nbsp; As I am honest,<br />
And as I am a maid yet, all my life<br />
From this <a name="p89_6" id="p89_6" class="fc">hour, since ye</a> make so free profession,<br />
I dedicate in service to your pleasure.<br />
<br />
<i>Soph.</i> &nbsp; I marry, this goes roundly off.<br />
<br />
<i>Petru.</i> &nbsp; Goe <i>Jaques</i>,<br />
Get all the best meat may be bought for money,<br />
And let the hogsheads blood, I am born again:<br />
Well little <i>England</i>, when I see a Husband<br />
Of any other Nation, stern or jealous,<br />
I'll wish him but a woman of thy breeding;<br />
And if he have not butter to <a name="p89_15" id="p89_15" class="fc">his bread</a>,<br />

<h3><i>Actus Primus. Sc&aelig;na Prima.</i></h3>


<p class="center"><i>A Bell Rings.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Enter</i> &nbsp; Pymero, Christophero, <i>and</i> Pedro.</p>

<p>
<i>Pymero.</i> &nbsp; Open the Ports, and see the Watch reliev'd,<br />
And let the guards be careful of their business,<br />
Their vigilant eyes fixt on these Islanders,<br />
They are false and desperate people, when they <a name="p92_7" id="p92_7" class="fc">find</a><br />
The least occasion open to encouragement,<br />
Cruel, and crafty souls, believe me Gentlemen,<br />
Their late attempt, which is too fresh amongst us,<br />
In which, against all arms and honesty,<br />
The Governor of <i>Ternata</i> made <a name="p92_12" id="p92_12" class="fc">surprize</a><br />
Of our Confederate, the King of <i>Tidore</i>,<br />
As for his recreation he was rowing<br />
Between both Lands, bids us be wise and circumspect.<br />
<br />
<i>Chr.</i> &nbsp; It was a mischief suddenly imagin'd,<br />
And as soon done; that Governor's a fierce knave,<br />
Unfaithful as he is fierce too, there's no trusting;<br />
But I wonder much, how such poor and base pleasures,<br />
As tugging at an Oar, or skill in Steerage,<br />
Should become Princes.<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; Base breedings, love base <a name="p92_22" id="p92_22" class="fc">pleasure</a>;<br />
They take as much delight in a <i>Baratto</i>,<br />
A little scurvy boat to row her <a name="p92_24" id="p92_24" class="fc">ti[th]ly</a>,<br />
And have the Art to turn and wind her nimbly,<br />
Think it as noble too, though it be slavish,<br />
And a dull labour that declines a Gentleman:<br />
As we <i>Portugals</i>, or the <i>Spaniards</i> do in riding,<br />
In managing a great horse, which is princely:<br />
The <i>French</i> in Courtship, or the dancing <i>English</i>,<br />
In carrying a fair presence.<br />
<br />
<i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; He was strangely taken;<br />
But where no faith is, there's no trust: he has paid for't<br />
His Sister yet the fair and great <i>Quisara</i>,<br />
Has shew'd a noble mind, and much love in't<br />
To her afflicted brother, and the nobler still it appears,<br />
And seasons of more tenderness, because his ruin stiles her absolute<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>And his imprisonment adds to her profit.<br />
Feeling all this, which makes all men admire her,<br />
The warm beams of this fortune that fall on her,<br />
Yet has she made divers and noble Treaties,<br />
And propositions for her brothers freedom,<br />
If wealth or honor&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; Peace, peace, you are fool'd, Sir;<br />
Things of these natures have strange outsides <i>Pedro</i>,<br />
And cunning shadows, set 'em far from us,<br />
Draw 'em but near, they are gross, and they abuse us;<br />
They that observe her close, shall find her nature,<br />
Which I doubt mainly will not prove so excellent;<br />
She is a Princess, and she must be fair,<br />
That's the prerogative of being Royal:<br />
Let her want eyes and nose, she must be beauteous,<br />
And she must know it too, and the use of it,<br />
And people must believe it, they are damn'd else:<br />
Why, all our neighbor Princes are mad for her.<br />
<br />
<i>Chr.</i> &nbsp; Is she not fair then?<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; But her hopes are fairer,<br />
And there's a haughty Master, the King of <i>Bakan</i>,<br />
That lofty Sir, that speaks far more, and louder<br />
In his own commendations, than a Cannon:<br />
He is strucken dumb with her.<br />
<br />
<i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; Beshrew me she is a sweet one.<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; And there's that hopeful man of <i>Syana</i>,<br />
That sprightly fellow, he that's wise and temperate,<br />
He is a Lover too.<br />
<br />
<i>Chr.</i> &nbsp; Wou'd I were worth her looking<br />
For; by my life I hold her a compleat one,<br />
The very Sun, I think affects her sweetness,<br />
And dares not, as he does to all else, dye it<br />
Into his tauny Livery.<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; She dares not see him,<br />
But keeps her self at distance from his kisses,<br />
And <a name="p93_35" id="p93_35" class="fc">[weares]</a> her complexion in a Case; let him but like it<br />
A week, or two, or three, she would look like a Lion;<br />
But the main sport on't is, or rather wonder<br />
The Governor of <i>Ternata</i>, her mortal enemy,<br />
He that has catcht her brother King, is struck too,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>And is arriv'd under safe conduct also,<br />
And hostages of worth delivered for him;<br />
And he brought a Letter from his prisoner,<br />
Whether compell'd, or willingly delivered<br />
From the poor King, or what else dare be in't.<br />
<br />
<i>Chr.</i> &nbsp; So it be honourable, any thing, 'tis all one<br />
For I dare think she'll do the best.<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis certain<br />
He has admittance, and sollicites hourly,<br />
Now if he have the trick&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; What trick?<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; The true one,<br />
To take her too, if he be but skill'd in Bat-fowling,<br />
And lime his bush right.<br />
<br />
<i>Chr.</i> &nbsp; I'll be hang'd when that hits,<br />
For 'tis not a compell'd, or forc'd affection<br />
That must take her, I guess her stout and virtuous,<br />
But where's your Uncle, Sir, our valiant Captain,<br />
The brave <i>Ruy Dias</i> all this while?<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; I marry.<br />
He is amongst 'em too.<br />
<br />
<i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; A Lover.<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; Nay,<br />
I know not that, but <a name="p94_23" id="p94_23" class="fc">[sure]</a> he stands in favour,<br />
Or would stand stifly, he is no <i>Portugal</i> else.<br />
<br />
<i>Chr.</i> &nbsp; The voice says in good favour, in the list too<br />
Of the privy wooers, how cunningly of late<br />
I have observ'd him, and how privately<br />
He has stolen at all hours from us, and how readily<br />
He has feign'd a business to bid the Fort farewel<br />
For five or six days, or a month together,<br />
Sure there is something&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; Yes, yes, there is a thing in't,<br />
A thing would make the best on's all dance after it;<br />
A dainty thing; Lord how this Uncle of mine<br />
Has read to me, and rated me for wenching.<br />
And told me in what desperate case 'twould leave me,<br />
And how 'twould stew my bones.<br />
<br />
<i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; You car'd not for it.<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; I'faith not much, I ventur'd on still easily,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>And took my chance, danger is a Soldiers honor;<br />
But that this man, this herb of Grace, <i>Ruy Dias</i>,<br />
This father of our faculties should slip thus,<br />
For sure he is a ferriting, that he<br />
That would drink nothing, to depress the spirit,<br />
But milk and water, eat nothing but thin air<br />
To make his bloud obedient, that his youth,<br />
In spight of all his temperance, should tickle,<br />
And have a love mange on him.<br />
<br />
<i>Chr.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis in him, Sir,<br />
But honourable courtship, and becomes his rank too.<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; In me 'twere abominable Leachery, or would be,<br />
For when our thoughts are on't, and miss their level,<br />
We must hit something.<br />
<br />
<i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; Well, he<a name="p95_14" id="p95_14" class="fc">'s a</a> noble Gentleman,<br />
And if he be a suitor, may he speed in't.<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; Let him alone, our family ne'r fail'd yet.<br />
<br />
<i>Chr.</i> &nbsp; Our mad Lieutenant still, merry <i>Pyniero</i>,<br />
Thus wou'd he do, if the Surgeon were searching of him.<br />
<br />
<i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; Especially if a warm wench had shot him.<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; But hark <i>Christophero</i>; come hither <i>Pedro</i>;<br />
When saw you our brave Countrey-man <i>Armusia</i>?<br />
He that's arriv'd here lately, and his gallants?<br />
A goodly fellow, and a brave companion<br />
Methinks he is, and no doubt, truly valiant,<br />
For he that dares come hither, dares fight any where.<br />
<br />
<i>Chr.</i> &nbsp; I saw him not of late, a sober Gentleman<br />
I am sure he is, and no doubt bravely sprung,<br />
And promises much nobleness.<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; I love him,<br />
And by my troth wou'd fain be inward with him;<br />
Pray let's go seek him.<br />
<br />
<i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; We'll attend you Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Py.</i> &nbsp; By that time we shall hear the burst of business.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span><br />

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Ruy Dias, Quisara, Quisana; <i>and</i> Panura.</p>

<p>
<i>Quisar.</i> &nbsp; Aunt, I much thank you for your courtesie,<br />
And the fair liberty you still allow me,<br />
Both of your house and service, though I be<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>A Princess, and by that Prerogative stand free<br />
From the poor malice of opinion,<br />
And no ways bound to render up my actions,<br />
Because no power above me can examine me;<br />
Yet my dear brother being still a prisoner,<br />
And many wandring eyes upon my ways,<br />
Being left <a name="p96_6" id="p96_6" class="fc">alone a Sea-mark</a>, it behoves me<br />
To use a little caution, and be circumspect.<br />
<br />
<i>Quisan.</i> &nbsp; You're wise and noble Lady.<br />
<br />
<i>Quisar.</i> &nbsp; Often Aunt<br />
I resort hither, and privately to see you,<br />
It may be to converse with some I favour;<br />
I wou'd not have it known as oft, nor constru'd,<br />
It stands not with my care.<br />
<br />
<i>Quisan.</i> &nbsp; You speak most fairly,<br />
For even our pure devotions are examin'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Quisar.</i> &nbsp; So mad are mens minds now.<br />
<br />
<i>Ruy.</i> &nbsp; Or rather monstrous;<br />
They are thick dreams, bred in fogs that know no fairness.<br />
<br />
<i>Quisan.</i> &nbsp; Madam, the House is yours, I am yours, pray use me,<br />
And at your service all I have lies prostrate;<br />
My care shall ever be to yield ye honor,<br />
And when your fame falls here, 'tis my fault Lady;<br />
A poor and simple banquet I have provided,<br />
Which if you please to honor with your presence&mdash;<br />

<i>Quisar.</i> &nbsp; I thank ye Aunt, I shall be with you instantly,<br />
A few words with this Gentleman.<br />

<i>Quisar.</i> &nbsp; Why, how now Captain, what afraid to speak to me?<br />
A man of Armes, and danted with a Lady?<br />
Commanders have the power to parle with Princes.<br />
<br />
<i>Ruy.</i> &nbsp; Madam, the favors you have still showr'd on me,<br />
Which are so high above my means of merit,<br />
So infinite, that nought can value 'em<br />
But their own goodness, no eyes look up to 'em<br />
But those that are of equal light, and lustre,<br />
Strike me thus mute, you are my royal Mistriss,<br />
And all my services that aime at honor,<br />
Take life from you, the Saint of my devotions;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>Pardon my wish, it is a fair ambition,<br />
And well becomes the Man that honors you;<br />
I wou'd I were of worth, of something near you,<br />
Of such a royal piece, a King I wou'd be,<br />
A mighty King that might command affection,<br />
And bring a youth upon me might bewitch ye,<br />
And you a sweet sould Christian.<br />
<br />
<i>Quisar.</i> &nbsp; Now you talk Sir;<br />
You <i>Portugals</i>, though you be rugged Soldiers,<br />
Yet when you list to flatter, you are plain Courtiers;<br />
And could you wish me <i>Christian</i>, brave <i>Ruy Dias</i>?<br />
<br />

At all my hopes, at all&mdash;<br />
<br />

To what end runs your wish?<br />
<br />

That I might&mdash;but I dare not speak.<br />
<br />
<i>Quisar.</i> &nbsp; I dare then,<br />
That you might hope to marry me; nay blush not,<br />
An honorable end needs no excuse;<br />
And would you love me then?<br />
<br />
<i>Ruy.</i> &nbsp; My soul not dearer.<br />
<br />
<i>Quisar.</i> &nbsp; Do some brave thing that may entice me that way,<br />
Some thing of such a meritorious goodness,<br />
Of such an unmatcht nobleness, that I may know<br />
You have a power beyond ours that preserves you:<br />
'Tis not the person, nor the royal title,<br />
Nor wealth, nor glory, that I look upon,<br />
That inward man I love that's lin'd with virtue,<br />
That well deserving soul works out a favor;<br />
I have many Princes suiters, many great ones,<br />
Yet above these I love you, you are valiant,<br />
An active man, able to build a fortune;<br />
I do not say I dote, nor meane to marry,<br />
Only the hope is, something may be done,<br />
That may compel my faith, and ask my freedome,<br />
And leave opinion fair.<br />
<br />
<i>Ruy.</i> &nbsp; Command dear Lady,<br />
And let the danger be as deep as Hell,<br />
As direful to attempt&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
<i>Quisar.</i> &nbsp; Y'are too sudden,<br />
I must be rul'd by you, find out a fortune<br />
Wisely, and hansomely, examine time,<br />
And court occasion that she may be ready;<br />
A thousand uses for your forward spirit<br />
Ye may find daily, be sure ye take a good one,<br />
A brave and worthy one that may advance ye,<br />
Forc'd smiles reward poor dangers; you are a Soldier,<br />
I wou'd not talke so else, and I love a Soldier,<br />
And that that speaks him true, and great, his valor;<br />
Yet for all these which are but Womens follies,<br />
You may do what you please, I shall still know ye,<br />
And though ye weare no Sword.<br />

We are arriv'd among the blessed Islands,<br />
Where every wind that rises blows perfumes,<br />
And every breath of air is like an Incence:<br />
The treasure of the Sun dwells here, each Tree<br />
As if it envied the old <i>Paradice</i>,<br />
Strives to bring forth immortal fruit; the Spices<br />
Renewing nature, though not deifying,<br />
And when that falls by time, scorning the earth,<br />
The sullen earth should taint or suck their beauties,<br />
But as we dreamt, for ever so preserve us:<br />
Nothing we see, but breeds an admiration;<br />
The very rivers as we float along,<br />
Throw up their pearls, and curle their heads to court us;<br />
The bowels of the earth swell with the births<br />
Of thousand unknown gemms, and thousand riches;<br />
Nothing that bears a life, but brings a treasure;<br />
The people they shew brave too, civil manner'd,<br />
Proportioned like the Masters of great minds,<br />
The Women which I wonder at&mdash;<br />

He grow not thus high hearted on't, I will coole ye,<br />

To work my ends, and willingly; and your sister taken down,<br />
Your scornful, cruel sister shall repent too,<br />
And sue to me for grace.<br />
Give him no liberty,<br />
But let his bands be doubled, his ease lessened;<br />
Nothing his heart desires, but vex and torture him:<br />
Let him not sleep, nothing that's dear to nature<br />
Let him enjoy; yet take heed that he dye not;<br />
Keep him as near death, and as willing to embrace it,<br />

That would have scour'd him else, and all his confines;<br />

At others fortunes; I may lye, and damnably,<br />
Beyond the patience of an honest hearer;<br />

And would not have the worlds eye find their knaveries:<br />
Your doors of danger, some men hate a pleasure,<br />
Unless that may be full of fears; your hope doors,<br />
And those are fine commodities, where fools pay<br />
For every new <a name="p129_32" id="p129_32" class="fc">enco[u]ragement</a>, a new custom;<br />
You have your doors of honor, and of pleasure;<br />

But these you do the best you can to damm up,<br />

And set your thoughts at peace; I am no flatterer,<br />

<i>Wit is become an Antick, and puts on<br />
As many shapes of variation,<br />
To court the times applause, as the times dare,<br />
Change several fashions, nothing is thought rare<br />
Which is not new, and follow'd, yet we know<br />
That what was worn some twenty years agoe,<br />
Comes into grace again, and we pursue<br />
That custom, by presenting to your view<br />
A Play in fashion then, not doubting now<br />
But 'twill appear the same, if you allow<br />
Worth to their noble memory, whose name,<br />
Beyond all power of death, live in their fame.</i><br />

Always vintage? have you Ships at Sea,<br />
To bring you Gold and Stone from rich <i>Peru</i>,<br />
Monthly returning Treasure? doth the King<br />
Open his large Exchequer to your hands<br />
And bid <a name="p173_8" id="p173_8" class="fc">ye be</a> a great man? can your wife<br />

Only to give the first creation glory!<br />

Left like the <i>Roman</i> Statues to stir up<br />
Our following hopes, the place it self puts on<br />
The brow of Majesty, and flings her lustre<br />

Like a fair heaven, in a frosty night:<br />

To give their worth and praises; Oh dear Cosin:<br />
You have a wife, and fair, bring her hither,<br />
Let her not live to be the Mistriss of a Farmers heir<br />
And be confin'd ever to a searge,<br />
Far courser than my horse-cloth.<br />
Let her have Velvets, Tiffinies, Jewels, Pearls,<br />
A Coach, an Usher, and her two Lacquies,<br />
And I will send my wife to give her rules,<br />
And read the rudiments of Court to her.<br />

Two Counts were newly ent'red.<br />

That place is not for women, Do you know me?<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; That's all one, I do know you and your business,<br />
You are discover'd Lady, I am wary,<br />
It stands upon my life; pray excuse me,<br />
The best man of this Kingdom sent you hither,<br />
To dive into me, have I toucht you? ha?<br />
<br />
<i>Lov.</i> &nbsp; You are deceiv'd Sir, I come from your love,<br />
That sends you fair commends, and many kisses.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; Alass, poor soul, How does she? Is she living?<br />
Keeps she her bed still?<br />
<br />
<i>Lov.</i> &nbsp; Still Sir, She is living,<br />
And well, and shall do so.<br />

<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; Are ye in counsel?<br />
<br />
<i>Lov.</i> &nbsp; No Sir, nor any of my sex.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; Why so,<br />
If you had been in counsel, you would know,<br />
Her time to be but slender; she must die.<br />
<br />
<i>Lov.</i> &nbsp; I do believe it, Sir.<br />
<br />

She stands too near a fortune.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis so,<br />
There is no jesting with a Princes Title,<br />
Would we had both been born of common parents,<br />
And liv'd a private and retir'd life,<br />
In homely cottage, we had then enjoyed,<br />
Our loves, and our embraces, these are things,<br />
That cannot tend to Treason&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Lov.</i> &nbsp; I am wretched.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; O I pray as often for the King as any,<br />
And with as true a heart, for's continuance,<br />
And do moreover pray his heirs may live;<br />
And their fair issues, then as I am bound<br />
For all the states and commons: if these prayers<br />
Be any wayes ambitious, I submit,<br />
And lay my head down, let 'em take it off;<br />
You may informe against me, but withall<br />
Remember my obedience to the Crown,<br />
And service to the State.<br />
<br />
<i>Lov.</i> &nbsp; Good Sir, I love ye.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; Then love the gracious King, and say with me.<br />
<br />
<i>Lov.</i> &nbsp; Heaven save his Grace.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; This is strange&mdash;<br />
A woman should be sent to undermine me,<br />
And buz love into me to try my spirit;<br />
Offer me kisses, and enticing follies,<br />
To make me open, and betray my self;<br />
It was a subtile and a dangerous plot,<br />
And very soundly followed, farewel Lady,<br />

The Country life is best, where quietly,<br />
Free from the clamor of the troubled Court,<br />

Why did I leave my house, and bring my Wife,<br />
To know the manner of this subtile place?<br />
I would, when first the lust to fame and honor,<br />

But that; had I been tied to stay at home,<br />

With my own hand, happy had I been.<br />

That you shall never see a Lord again;<br />
You shall not see a Maske, or Barriers,<br />
Or Tilting, or a solemn Christning,<br />
Or a great Marriage, or new Fire-works,<br />
Or any bravery; but you shall live<br />

<i>Wif.</i> &nbsp; No, no, he is resolv'd, he will not<br />
Stir a foot, I'll lay my life.<br />
<br />
<i>Bew.</i> &nbsp; I, but he's discontented, how shall we resolve that,<br />
And make him stay with comfort?<br />
<br />
<i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Faith <i>Bewford</i> we must even let nature work,<br />
For he's the sweetest temper'd man for that<br />
As one can wish, for let men but go about to fool him,<br />
And he'll have his finger as deep in't as the best;<br />
But see where he comes frowning, bless us all!<br />
</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Duke.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; Off with your hats, for here doth come<br />
The high and mighty Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>.<br />
What ever you may think, I have thought<br />
And thought, and thought upon't, and I find it plain,<br />
The King cannot take back what he has given,<br />
Unless I forfeit it by course of Law.<br />
Not all the water in the River <i>Seine</i>,<br />
Can wash the blood out of these Princely veins.<br />
<br />
<i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; God-a-mercy Husband, thou art the best<br />
To work out a thing at a pinch in <i>France</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; I will ascend my State again,<br />
Duchess, take your place,<br />
And let our Champion enter.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
<i>Long.</i> &nbsp; Has he his Champion? that's excellent.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; And let loud Musick sound before his entrance.<br />
Sound Trumpet.<br />
</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Jaques <i>in Armor</i>, <i>one carrying a Scutcheon before him</i>, <i>and a two-handed Sword</i>.</p>

<p>
<i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; How well our Champion doth demean himself,<br />
As if he had been made for such an action?<br />
Methinks his sturdy truncheon he doth weild,<br />
Like <i>Mars</i> approaching to a bloody field.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; I think there's no man so desperate<br />
To dare encounter with our Champion,<br />
But trust me, <i>Jaques</i>, thou hast pleas'd us well;<br />
Once more our warlike Musick, then proceed.<br />
</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Shattillion.</p>

<p>
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; What wondrous age is this! what close proceedings!<br />
I hear the clang of Trumpets in this house,<br />
To what intent do not our States-men search?<br />
Oh no, they look not into simple truth;<br />
For I am true, and they regard not me,<br />
A man in Armor too: God save the King,<br />
The world will end, there's nought but treachery.<br />
<br />
<i>Jaq.</i> &nbsp; I <i>Jaques</i>, servant to the high and mighty <i>Godfrey</i>,<br />
Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, do come hither to prove by natural<br />
strength, and activity of my body, without the help of sorcery,<br />
inchantment, or negromancy, that the said <i>Godfrey</i>,<br />
late of <i>Mount Marine</i>, and now of <i>Burgundy</i>, hath perfect<br />
right thereto, notwithstanding the Kings command to the<br />
contrary, and no other person whatsoever: and in token<br />
that I will be ready to make good the same: I throw down<br />
my gage, which is my honor, pronounced the 37 of <i>Feb.<br />
Stilo novo</i>, <i>God save the</i> Duke.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; Of all the plots the King hath laid for me<br />
This was the shrewdest, 'tis my life they seek<br />
And they shall have it: if I should refuse<br />
To accept the challenge in the Kings behalf,<br />
They have some cause to take away my life,<br />
And if I do accept it, who can tell,<br />
But I may fall by doubtful chance of War?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>'Twas shrew'd, but I must take the least of evils,<br />
I take thy gauntlet up, thou treacherous man,<br />
That stands in armed Coat against the King.<br />
Whom God preserve, and with my single sword,<br />
Will justifie whatever he commands;<br />
I'll watch him for catching of my words.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; <i>Jaques</i> go on, defend our Princely Title.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; Why shrink'st thou back? thou hast an evil cause;<br />
Come forward man, I have a rock about me,<br />
I fight for my true Liege.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; Go forward <i>Jaques</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Jaq.</i> &nbsp; I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,<br />
I will not fight with him, with any else<br />
I'll shew my resolution speedily.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; Come, do thy worst, for the King shall see<br />
All is not true, that is reported of me.<br />
<br />
<i>Jaq.</i> &nbsp; I may not fight with him by Law of Arms.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; What? shall my Title fall? wilt thou not fight?<br />
<br />
<i>Jaq.</i> &nbsp; Never with him that once hath sav'd my life.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; Dar'st thou not fight? behold then, I do go<br />
Strong with the zeal I bear my Sovereign,<br />
And seize upon that haughty man himself.<br />
Descend the steps (that thou hast thus usurp'd<br />
Against the King and State,) down to the ground,<br />
And if thou do utter but a syllable<br />
To cross the Kings intent, thou art but dead;<br />
There, lye upon the earth, and pine, and dye.<br />
Did ever any man wade through such storms<br />
To save his life, as poor <i>Shattillion</i>?<br />
<br />
<i>Long.</i> &nbsp; I fear this challenge hath spoil'd all.<br />
<br />
<i>Duc.</i> &nbsp; Ne'er fear it, he'll work it out again, servant.<br />
See where <i>Shattillion's</i> Love, poor Lady, comes.<br />

<i>Duke. Jaques.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Jaq.</i> &nbsp; Lie still, Sir, if you love your life, I'll whistle when he's gone,<br />
<br />
<i>Love.</i> &nbsp; Oh Gentlemen, I charge you by the Love<br />
Which you bear to women, take some pitty<br />
On this distressed man, help to restore<br />
That precious Jewel to him he hath lost.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
<i>Bew.</i> &nbsp; Lady, what ever power doth lie in us<br />
By Art, or Prayer, or danger, we are yours.<br />
<br />
<i>Love.</i> &nbsp; A strange conceit hath wrought this malady,<br />
Conceits again must bring him to himself,<br />
My strict denial to his Will wrought this:<br />
And if you could but draw his wilder thoughts<br />
To know me, he would sure recover sense.<br />
<br />
<i>Long.</i> &nbsp; That charge I'll undertake.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; Look <i>Jaques</i>, look, for Gods sake let me rise,<br />
This greatness is a jade, I cannot sit it.<br />
<br />
<i>Jaq.</i> &nbsp; His sword is up, and yet he watcheth you.<br />
<br />
<i>Du.</i> &nbsp; I'll down again, pray for thy Master, <i>Jaques</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; Now the King may see all the suggestions are not true,<br />
He hath receiv'd against my loyalty;<br />
When all men else refuse, I fight his battels,<br />
And thrust my body into dangers mouth;<br />
I am become his Champion, and this sword<br />
Has taught his enemies to know themselves;<br />
Oh that he would no more be jealous of me!<br />
<br />
<i>Long.</i> &nbsp; Monsieur <i>Shattillion</i>, the King <a name="p236_19" id="p236_19" class="fc">ass[ign]s</a> you,<br />
That for this valiant loyal act of yours,<br />
He hath forgot all jealousies and fears,<br />
And never more will tempt you into danger.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; But how shall I believe this, what new token<br />
Of reconcilement will he shew me?<br />
Let him release my poor Love from her torment,<br />
From her hard fare, and strict imprisonment.<br />
<br />
<i>Long.</i> &nbsp; He hath done this to win your after-love,<br />
And see your Lady sent you from the King<br />
By these two Gentlemen: be thankful for her.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; She lives, she lives, I know her by the power<br />
Shoots from her eyes.<br />
<br />
<i>Love.</i> &nbsp; Rise dear <i>Shattillion</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; I know my duty,<br />
Next unto my King, I am to kneel to you.<br />
<br />
<i>Love.</i> &nbsp; I'll have you rise, fetch me a chair, sit down <i>Shat</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; I am commanded, and faith tell me Mistriss,<br />
What usage have you had? pray be plain!<br />
<br />
<i>Love.</i> &nbsp; Oh my most lov'd <i>Shattillion</i>, pain enough,<br />
But now I am free, thanks to my God and King.<br />

To satisfie the world of our true right,<br />
And it is dangerous.<br />
<br />

Were it to bring the great Turk bound in chains<br />
Through <i>France</i> in triumph: or to couple up<br />
The <i>Sophie</i>, and great <i>Prestor John</i> together,<br />
I would attempt it Duchess, tell the course.<br />
<br />
<i>Duc.</i> &nbsp; There is a strong opinion through the world,<br />
And no doubt, grounded on experience,<br />
That Lions will not touch a lawful Prince,<br />
If you be confident then of your right,<br />
Amongst the Lions bear your naked body,<br />
And if you come off clear, and never winch,<br />
The world will say you are a perfect Prince.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; I thank you Duchess, for your kind advice,<br />
But now we do not affect those ravenous beasts.<br />
<br />
<i>Long.</i> &nbsp; A Lion is a beast to try a King;<br />
But for the trial of such a state like this<br />
<i>Pliny</i> &nbsp; reports a mastive dog will serve.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; We will not deal with dogs at all, but men.<br />
<br />
<i>Serv.</i> &nbsp; You shall not need to deal with them at all,<br />
Hark you Sir, the King doth know you are a Duke:<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; No, does he?<br />
<br />
<i>Serv.</i> &nbsp; Yes, and is content you shall be, but with this caution,<br />
That none know it but your self:<br />
For if ye do, he'll take it away by Act of Parliament.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; Here's my hand, and whilst I live or breath,<br />
No living wight shall know I am a Duke.<br />
<br />
<i>Serv.</i> &nbsp; Mark me directly, Sir, your wife may know it.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; May not <i>Jaques</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Serv.</i> &nbsp; Yes, he may.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; May not my Countrey Cosin?<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Duke.</i> &nbsp; Well then, know all, I am no Duke.<br />
<br />
<i>Serv.</i> &nbsp; No, I'll swear it.<br />
<br />

Sleep hath not sate so sound upon mine eyes<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>But I remember well that face;<br />
Oh thou too cruel, leave at length to scorn<br />
Him that but looking on thy beauty, dies,<br />
Either receive me, or put out my eyes.<br />

I offer up my love, forget my wrongs.<br />
<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; Art thou mine own?<br />

<br />

<br />
<i>Shat.</i> &nbsp; Tell nothing, but that thou art mine own:<br />
I do not care to know where I have been,<br />
Or how I have liv'd, or any thing,<br />
But that thou art my own.<br />
<br />
<i>Bew.</i> &nbsp; Well wife, though 'twere a trick that made us wed,<br />
We'll make our selves merry soon in bed.<br />

Now all my labours have a perfect end, as I could wish,<br />

Her safety in't, for I must tell thee boy,<br />

I should advance thy hopes another way,<br />

<br />
<i>Sel.</i> &nbsp; Madam, to reconcile two families<br />
That may unite, both Counsels and their blood<br />
To serve your Crown.<br />
<br />
<i>Qu.</i> &nbsp; <i>Macarius</i>, and <i>Eubulus</i><br />
That beare inveterate malice to each other.<br />
It grew, as I have heard, upon the question<br />
Which some of either family had made<br />
Which of their Fathers was the best Commander:<br />
If we believe our stories, they have both<br />
Deserved well of our state, and yet this quarrel<br />
Has cost too many lives, a severe faction.<br />
<br />
<i>Sel.</i> &nbsp; But I'll propound a way to plant a quiet<br />
And peace in both our houses, which are torn<br />
With their dissentions, and lose the glory<br />
Of their great names, my blood speaks my relation<br />
To <i>Eubulus</i>, and I wish my veins were emptied<br />
To appease their war.<br />
<br />
<i>Qu.</i> &nbsp; Thou hast a noble soul,<br />
This is a charity above thy youth,<br />
And it flows bravely from thee, name the way.<br />
<br />
<i>Sel.</i> &nbsp; In such a desperate cause, a little stream<br />
Of blood might purge the foulness of their hearts<br />
If you'll prevent a deluge.<br />
<br />
<i>Qu.</i> &nbsp; Be particular.<br />
<br />
<i>Sel.</i> &nbsp; Let but your Majesty consent that two<br />
May with their personal valour, undertake<br />
The honor of their family, and determine<br />
Their difference.<br />
<br />
<i>Qu.</i> &nbsp; This rather will inlarge<br />
Their hate, and be a means to call more blood<br />
Into the stream.<br />
<br />
<i>Sel.</i> &nbsp; Not if both families<br />
Agree, and swear&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Qu.</i> &nbsp; And who shall be the Champions?<br />
<br />
<i>Sel.</i> &nbsp; I beg the honor, for <i>Eubulus</i> cause<br />
To be ingag'd, if any for <i>Macarius</i>,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>Worthy to wager heart with mine, accept it,<br />

Will not deny, to stake against my life<br />
His own, if you vouchsafe us priviledge.<br />
<br />
<i>Qu.</i> &nbsp; You are the expectation, and top boughs<br />
Of both your houses, it would seem injustice,<br />
To allow a civil war to cut you off,<br />
And your selves the instruments, besides<br />
You appear a soldier; <i>Arcadius</i><br />
Hath no acquaintance yet with rugged war,<br />
More fit to drill a Lady, than expose<br />
His body to such dangers: a small wound<br />
I'th' head, may spoil the method of his hair,<br />
Whose curiosity exacts more time,<br />
Than his devotion, and who knows but he<br />
May lose his ribond by it in his lock,<br />
Dear as his Saint, with whom he would exchange<br />
His head, for her gay colours; then his band<br />
May <a name="p249_19" id="p249_19" class="fc">[b]e</a> disorder'd, and transform'd from Lace<br />
To Cutwork, his rich cloaths be discomplexioned<br />
With bloud, beside the infashionable slashes:<br />
And at the next Festival take Physick,<br />
Or put on black, and mourn for his slain breeches:<br />
His hands cas'd up in gloves all night, and sweet<br />
<i>Pomatum</i>: the next day may be endanger'd<br />
To blisters with a sword, how can he stand<br />
Upon his guard, who hath Fidlers in his head,<br />
To which, his feet must ever be a dancing?<br />
Beside a falsify may spoil his cringe,<br />
Or making of a leg, in which consists<br />
Much of his Court-perfection.<br />
<br />

Bestow'd on him?<br />

Whom if you please to challenge<br />

I shall burst else, I have no skill in Jiggs,<br />
Nor Tumbling.<br />
<br />
<i>Qu.</i> &nbsp; How Sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Sel.</i> &nbsp; Nor was I born a Minstrel, and in this you have<br />
So infinitely disgrac'd <i>Arcadius</i>.<br />
But that I have heard another Character,<br />

<p>
<i>Pol.</i> &nbsp; Oh where shall Virgins look for faith hereafter?<br />
If he prove false, after so many vowes?<br />
And yet if I consider, he was tempted<br />
Above the strength of a young Lover, two<br />
Such glorious courting his acceptance, were<br />
Able to make disloyalty no sin,<br />
At least not seem a fault, a Lady first,<br />
Whose very looks would thaw a man more frozen<br />
Than the <i>Alps</i>, quicken a soul more dead than Winter,<br />
Add to her beauty and perfection,<br />
That she's a Queen, and brings with her a Kingdom<br />
Able to make a great mind forfeit Heaven.<br />
What could the frailty of <i>Arcadius</i><br />
Suggest, to unspirit him so much, as not<br />
To fly to her embraces, you were present<br />
When she declar'd her self.<br />
<br />
<i>Ser.</i> &nbsp; Yes Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Pol.</i> &nbsp; Tell me,<br />
Did not he make a pause, when the fair Queen<br />
A full temptation stood him?<br />
<br />
<i>Ser.</i> &nbsp; Very little<br />
My judgment could distinguish, she did no sooner<br />
Propound, but he accepted.<br />
<br />
<i>Pol.</i> &nbsp; That was ill,<br />
He might with honor stand one or two minutes,<br />
Me thinks it should have startled him a little,<br />
To have rememberd me, I have deserv'd<br />
At least a cold thought, well, pray give it him.<br />
<br />
<i>Ser.</i> &nbsp; I shall.<br />
<br />
<i>Pol.</i> &nbsp; When?<br />
<br />
<i>Ser.</i> &nbsp; Instantly.<br />
<br />
<i>Pol.</i> &nbsp; Not so,<br />
But take a time when his joy swels him most,<br />
When his delights are high and ravishing,<br />
When you perceive his Soul dance in his eyes,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>When she that must be his hath drest her beauty,<br />
With all her pride, and sends a thousand <i>Cupids</i><br />

I'll pray for him.<br />

Consider, Sir, it was her sin, not his;<br />
I cannot accuse him, what man could carry<br />

Be charitable to thy self, and let him live<br />
To glory in thy shame? Nor is he innocent;<br />
He had before crept slily into her bosome,<br />
And practised thy dishonor.<br />
<br />
<i>Lisi.</i> &nbsp; You begin to stir me, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Cas.</i> &nbsp; How else could she be guilty<br />
Of such contempt of thee? and in the eye<br />
Of all the Kingdom, they conspir'd this stain,<br />
When they had cunning meetings, shall thy love<br />
And blooming hopes be scatter'd thus, and <i>Lisimachus</i><br />
Stand idle gazer?<br />

<p><i>This Comedy long forgot, by some thought dead,<br />
By us preserv'd, once more doth raise her head.<br />
And to your noble censures does present,<br />
Her outward form, and inward ornament.<br />
Nor let this smell of arrogance, since 'tis known,<br />
The makers that confest it for their own<br />
Were this way skilful, and without the crime<br />
Of flatteries I may say did please the time;<br />
The work it self too, when it first came forth,<br />
In the opinion of men of worth,<br />
Was well receiv'd and favour'd, though some rude<br />
And harsh among <a name="p309_13" id="p309_13" class="fc">th'</a> ignorant multitude,<br />
(That relish gross food, better than a dish,<br />
That's cook'd with care, and serv'd into the wish,<br />
Of curious pallats) wanting wit and strength,<br />
Truly to judge, condemn'd it for the length,<br />
That fault's reform'd, and now 'tis to be try'd<br />
Before such Judges 'twill not be deny'd<br />
A free and noble hearing: nor fear I,<br />
But 'twill deserve to have free liberty,<br />
And give you cause (and with content) to say,<br />
Their care was good, that did revive this Play.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Richardo <i>and</i> Viola.</p>

<p>
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; Let us make use of this stolen privacy,<br />
And not loose time in protestation, Mistriss,<br />
For 'twere in me a kind of breach of faith,<br />
To say again I love you.<br />
<br />
<i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; Sweet, speak softly<br />
For though the venture of your love to me,<br />
Meets with a willing, and a full return:<br />
Should it arrive unto my Fathers knowledge;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>This were our last discourse.<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; How shall he know it?<br />
<br />
<i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; His watching cares are such, for my advancement,<br />
That every where his eye is fix'd upon me:<br />
This night that does afford us some small freedom,<br />
At the request and much intreaty of<br />
The Mistriss of the House, was hardly given me:<br />
For I am never suffer'd to stir out,<br />
But he hath spies upon me: yet I know not<br />
You have so won upon me, that could I think<br />
You would love faithfully (though to entertain<br />
Another thought of you, would be my death)<br />
I should adventure on his utmost anger.<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; Why do you think I can be false?<br />
<br />
<i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; No faith,<br />
<a name="p310_15" id="p310_15" class="fc">You [h]ave</a> an honest face, but if you should&mdash;<br />

<br />
<i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; No more, I do believe you, the dance ended,<br />
Which this free womans ghests have vow'd to have<br />
E'r they depart, I will make home, and store me<br />
With all the Jewels, Chains, and Gold are trusted<br />
Unto my custody, and at the next corner,<br />
To my Fathers house, before one at the farthest,<br />
Be ready to receive me.<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; I desire<br />
No bond beyond your promise, let's go in,<br />
To talk thus much, before the door, may breed<br />
Suspition.<br />
</p>

Will bless our undertakings.<br />
<br />
<i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis my wish, Sir.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Exit</i> Rich. <i>and</i> Vio.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Nay, Sir, excuse me, I have drawn you to<br />
Too much expence already in my travel:<br />
And you have been too forward in your love;<br />
To make my wants your own, allow me manners<br />
Which you must grant I want, should I increase,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>The bond in which your courtesies have ti'd me:<br />
<a name="p311_1" id="p311_1" class="fc">By</a> still consuming you, give me leave<br />
To take mine own ways now, and I shall often,<br />
With willingness, come to visit you, and then thank you.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; By this hand I could be angry, what do you think me?<br />
Must we that have so long time been as one<br />
Seen Cities, Countreys, Kingdoms, and their wonders;<br />
Been bedfellows, and in our various journey<br />
Mixt all our observations, part (as if<br />
We were two Carriers at two several ways,<br />
And as the fore-horse guides, cry God be with you)<br />
Without or compliment, or ceremony?<br />
In Travellers, that know transalpine garbs,<br />
Though our designs are nee'r so serious, friend,<br />
It were a capital crime, it must not be:<br />
Nay, what is more, you shall not; you e'r long,<br />
Shall see my house, and find what I call mine<br />
Is wholly at your service.<br />
<br />
<i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis this tires me,<br />
Sir, I were easily woo'd, if nothing else<br />
But my Will lay in the choice: but 'tis not so,<br />
My friends and kindred that have part of me,<br />
And such on whom my chiefest hopes depend,<br />
Justly expect the tender of my love<br />
After my travel: then mine own honesty<br />
Tells me 'tis poor, having indifferent means<br />
To keep me in my quality and rank,<br />
At my return, to tire anothers bounty,<br />
And let mine own grow lusty, pardon me.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; I will not, cannot, to conclude, I dare not:<br />
Can any thing conferr'd upon my friend<br />
Be burthensome to me? for this excuse<br />
Had I no reason else, you should not leave me,<br />
By a travellers faith you should not, I have said,<br />
And then you know my humor, there's no contending.<br />
<br />
<i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Is there no way to 'scape this Inundation?<br />
I shall be drown'd with folly if I go:<br />
And after nine days, men may take me up,<br />
With my gall broken.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; Are you yet resolv'd?<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
<i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Wou'd you would spare me.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; By this light I cannot<br />
By all that may be sworn by.<br />
<br />
<i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Patience help me,<br />
And heaven grant his folly be not catching:<br />
If it be, the Town's undone, I now would give<br />
A reasonable sum of gold to any Sheriff,<br />
That would but lay an execution on me,<br />
And free me from his company; while he was abroad,<br />
His want of wit and language kept him dumb?<br />
But <i>Balaam's</i> Asse will speak now, without spurring.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; Speak, have I won you?&mdash;<br />

<br />
<i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; There is a thing in hand.<br />
<br />
<i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Why? What thing?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; A sound one, if it take right, and you be not peevish.
We two will be&mdash;you would little think it; as famous for our

<br />
<i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; No, by my troth, Sir; he will not help me up sure.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; You shall anon, and for our names, I think they shall
live after us, and be remember'd while there is a story; or <a name="p328_3" id="p328_3" class="fc">[I]</a>

<br />
<i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; You shall enjoy my wife.<br />

I have made it perfect.<br />

there is no mercy to be used towards him, he is not capable
of any pitty, he will in spight of course be a Cuckold, And
who can help it? must it begin so needs Sir?&mdash;think agen.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; Yes marry must it, and I my self will woe this
woman for you, Do you perceive it now? ha?<br />

thy head should be so monstrous, that all thy Servants hats may
hang upon't! but do you meane to do this?<br />
<br />

against it, 'tis the overthrow of the best plot that ever was
then.<br />
<br />
<i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Nay, I'll assure you, Sir, I'll do no harm, you have
too much about you of your own.<br />

<i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; Night, that was ever friend to Lovers, yet<br />
Has rais'd some weary Soul, that hates his bed,<br />
To come and see me blush, and then laugh at me.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; H'ad a rude heart that did this.</p>

<p>
<i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; Gentle Sir,<br />
If you have that which honest men call pitty,<br />
And be as far from evil as you shew;<br />
Help a poor Maid, that this night by bad fortune<br />
Has been thus us'd by Robbers.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; A pox upon his heart that would not help thee, this
Thief was half a Lawyer by his bands, How long have you
been tyed here?</p>

<p><i>Viol.</i> &nbsp; Alas, this hour, and with cold and fear am almost
perisht.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Where were the watch the while? good sober Gent.
they were like careful members of the City, drawing in
diligent Ale, and singing catches, while Mr. Constable contriv'd
the Tosts: these fellows would be more severely
punisht than wandring Gipsies, that every statute whips; for
if they had every one two eyes a piece more, three pots
would put them out.</p>

<p><i>Viol.</i> &nbsp; I cannot tell, I found no Christian to give me succor.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; When they take a Thief, I'll take <i>Ostend</i> agen; the
whorsons drink Opium in their Ale, and then they sleep like
tops; as for their bills, they only serve to reach down Bacon
to make Rashers on; now let me know whom I have done
this courtesie too, that I may thank my early rising for it.</p>

<p><i>Viol.</i> &nbsp; Sir, All I am, you see.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; You have a name I'm sure, and a kindred, a Father,
friend, or something that must own you; shee's a handsome
young Wench; What Rogues were these to Rob her?</p>

<p>
<i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; Sir, you see all I dare reveale,<br />
And as you are a Gentleman press me no further;<br />
For there begins a grief, whose bitterness<br />
Will break a stronger heart than I have in me,<br />
And 'twill but make you heavy with the hearing,<br />
For your own goodness sake desire it not.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; If you would not have me enquire that, How do
you live then?</p>

<p>
<i>Viol.</i> &nbsp; How I have liv'd, is still one question,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>Which must not be resolv'd&mdash;<br />
How I desire to live, is in your liking,<br />
So worthy an opinion I have of you.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Is in my liking? How I pray thee? tell me, i'faith
I'll do you any good lies in my power; she has an eye would
raise a bedrid man; come, leave your fear, and tell me, that's
a good Wench.</p>

<p><i>Viol.</i> &nbsp; Sir, I would serve&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Who would'st thou serve? do not weep and tell
me.</p>

<p><i>Viol.</i> &nbsp; Faith, Sir, even some good woman, and such a wife
if you be married, I do imagine yours.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Alas! thou art young and tender, let me see thy
hand, this was ne'er made to wash, or wind up water, beat
cloaths, or rub a floor, by this light, for one use that shall
be nameless, 'tis the best wanton hand that e're I lookt on.</p>

<p>
<i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; Dare you accept me, Sir, my heart is honest,<br />
Among your vertuous charitable deeds,<br />
This will not be the least.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Thou canst in a Chamber?</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; In a Chamber, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; I mean wait there upon a Gentlewoman,<br />
How quick she is, I like that mainly too;<br />
I'll have her, though I keep her with main strength like a
besieged Town, for I know I shall have the Enemy afore me
within a week.</p>

<p>
<i>Viol.</i> &nbsp; Sir, I can sow too, and make pretty laces,<br />
Dress a head handsome, teach young Gentlewomen,<br />
For in all these I have a little knowledge.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis well, no doubt I shall encrease that knowledge;
I like her better still, how she provokes me; pritty young
Maid, you shall serve a good Gentlewoman, though I say't,
that will not be unwilling you should please me, nor I forgetful
if you do.</p>

<p><i>Viol.</i> &nbsp; I am the happier.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; My man shall make some shift to carry you behind
him, Can you ride well?</p>

<p><i>Viola.</i> &nbsp; But I'll hold fast for catching of a fall.</p>

I have my wits.</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; So have I, but they are unsetled ones, would I had
some porrige.</p>

<p>
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; The Tavern boy was here this morning with me<br />
And told me, that there was a Gentlewoman,<br />
Which he took for a Whore, that hung on me:<br />
For whom we quarrel'd, and I know not what.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; I faith nor I.</p>

<p><i>Ube.</i> &nbsp; I have a glimmering of some such thing.</p>

<p>
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; Was it you, <i>Silvio</i>,<br />
That made me drink so much? 'twas you or <i>Pedro</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; I know not who.</p>

<p><i>Sil.</i> &nbsp; We <a name="p337_14" id="p337_14" class="fc">[were]</a> all apt enough.</p>

<p>
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; But I will lay the fault on none but me,<br />
That I would be so entreated, come <i>Silvio</i>,<br />
Shall we go drink agen, come Gentlemen,<br />
Why do you stay, let's never leave off now,<br />
Whil'st we have Wine, and Throats, I'll practise it,<br />
Till I have made it my best quality;<br />
For what is best for me to do but that?<br />
For <a name="p337_22" id="p337_22" class="fc">[Gods]</a> sake come and drink; when I am nam'd,<br />
Men shall make answer, Which <i>Richardo</i> mean you?<br />
The excellent drinker? I will have it so,<br />
Will you go drink?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Silv.</i> &nbsp; We drunk too much too lately.</p>

<p>
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; Why there is then the less behind to drink,<br />
Let's end it all, dispatch that, wee'l send abroad,<br />
And purchase all the Wine the world can yield,<br />
And then drink it off, then take the fruits o'th' earth,<br />
Distil the Juice from them, and drink that off;<br />
Wee'l catch the rain before it fall to ground,<br />
And drink off that that never more may grow;<br />
Wee'l set our mouths to Springs, and drink them off,<br />
And all this while wee'l never think of those<br />
That love us best, more than we did last night.<br />
We will not give unto the poor a drop<br />
Of all this drink, but when we see them weep,<br />
Wee'l run to them, and drink their tears off too,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>Wee'l never leave whilst there is heat or moisture,<br />
In this large globe, but suck it cold and dry,<br />
Till we have made it Elemental earth,<br />
Merely by drinking.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; Is't flattery to tell you, you are mad?</p>

<p>
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; If it be false,<br />
There's no such way to bind me to a Man;<br />
He that will have me, lay my goods and lands,<br />
My life down for him, need no more, but say,<br />
<i>Richardo</i> &nbsp; thou art mad, and then all these<br />
Are at his service, then he pleases me,<br />
And makes me think that I had vertue in me,<br />
That I had love, and tenderness of heart,<br />
That though I have committed such a fault,<br />
As never creature did, yet running mad,<br />
As honest men should do for such a crime,<br />
I have exprest some worth, though it be late:<br />
But I alas have none of these in me,<br />
But keep my wits still like a frozen Man,<br />
That had no fire within him.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Sil.</i> &nbsp; Nay, good <i>Richardo</i> leave this wild talk, and send a
letter to her, I'll deliver it.</p>

<p>
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis to no purpose; perhaps she's lost last night,<br />
Or she got home agen, she's now so strictly<br />
Look'd to, the wind can scarce come to her, or admit<br />
She were her self; if she would hear from me,<br />
From me unworthy, that have us'd her thus,<br />
She were so foolish, that she were no more<br />
To be belov'd.<br />

his Whore that <a name="p338_34" id="p338_34" class="fc">had it in a Tap-house</a>, whom we apprehended,

<p><i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; And murthered her?</p>

<p><i>Sil.</i> &nbsp; What aile you man?</p>

<p><i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; Why all this doth not make me mad.</p>

look to his sword.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ser.</i> &nbsp; They do deny the killing of her, but swore they left
her tyed to a Tree, in the fields, next those Suburbs that are
without our Ladies gate, near day, and by the Rode, so that
some passinger must needs unty her quickly.</p>

<p><i>And.</i> &nbsp; The will of Heaven be done! Sir, I will only entreat
you this, that as you were the greatest occasion of her
loss, that you will be pleased to urge your friends, and be
your self earnest in the search of her; if she be found, she

<p>
<i>Ric.</i> &nbsp; What think you now of me, I think this lump<br />
Is nothing but a piece of fleagme congeal'd<br />
Without a soul, for where there's so much spirit<br />
As would but warm a flea, those faults of mine<br />
Would make it glow, and flame in this dull heart,<br />
And run like molten gold through every sin,<br />
Till it could burst these walls, and fly away.<br />
Shall I intreat you all to take your horses,<br />
And search this innocent?<br />

<p><i>Ped.</i> &nbsp; With all our hearts.</p>

<p>
<i>Ric.</i> &nbsp; Do not divide your selves till you come there,<br />
Where they say she was ty'd, I'll follow too,<br />
But never to return till she be found.<br />

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; A Gentleman, I'll lay my life, you puppy, h'as sent

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Wife <i>with a Letter</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; I am glad I found you Sir, there, take your Letter,
and keep it till you have another friend to wrong, 'tis too
malicious false to make me sin, you have provoked me to
be that I love not, a talker, and you shall hear me.<br />
Why should you dare to imagine me<br />
So light a huswife, that from four hours knowledge<br />
You might presume to offer to my credit<br />
This rude and ruffian tryal, I am sure<br />
I never courted you, nor gave you tokens,<br />
That might concern assurance, you are a fool.<br />
</p>

<p>
<i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; I cannot blame you now, I see this letter,<br />
Though you be angry, yet with me you must not,<br />
Unless you'l make me guilty of a wrong,<br />
My worst affections hate&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Did not you send it?</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; No, upon my faith, which is more, I understand
it not; the hand is as far from my knowledge, as the malice.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; This is strange.</p>

<p>
<i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; It is so, and had been stranger, and indeed more hateful,<br />
Had I, that have receiv'd such courtesies, and owe so many<br />
Thanks, done this base office.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Your name is at it.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Yes, but not my nature, and I shall hate my name
worse than the manner, for this base broking; you are wise
and vertuous, remove this fault from me; for on the love
I bear to truth and goodness, this Letter dare not name me
for the author.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Now I perceive my husbands knavery, <a name="p340_30" id="p340_30" class="fc">if [my]</a> man
can but find where he has been, I will goe with this Gentleman
whatsoever comes on't: and as I mean to carry it, both
he and all the World shall think it fit, and thank me for it.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; I must confess I loved you, at first, however this
made me leave your house unmannerly, that might provoke
me to do something ill, both to your honor and my faith,
and not to write this Letter, which I hold so truly wicked,
that I will not think on't.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; I do believe you, and since I see you are free, my
words were not meant to you, but this is not the half of
my affliction.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis pitty you should know more vexation; may I
enquire?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Faith, Sir, I fear I have lost my husband.</p>

<p><i>Ser.</i> &nbsp; Faith I have found at length, by chance, where he
has been.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Where?</p>

<p><i>Ser.</i> &nbsp; In a blind out-house in the Suburbs, pray God all be
well with him.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Why?</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> &nbsp; There are his cloaths, but, What's become of him,<br />
I cannot yet enquire.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; I am glad of this; sure they have murther'd him,<br />
What shall I do?</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Be not so grieved, before you know the truth, you
have time enough to weep, this is the sodain'st mischief;
Did you not bring an Officer to search there, where you say
you found his cloaths.</p>

<p><i>Ser.</i> &nbsp; Yes, and we searcht it, and charg'd the fellow with
him: but he, like a Rogue, stubborn Rogue, made answer, he
knew not where he was; he had been there, but where he was
now, he could not tell: I tell you true, I fear him.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Are all my hopes and longings to enjoy him,<br />
After this 3 years travel, come to this?</p>

<p><i>Ser.</i> &nbsp; It is the rankest house in all the City, the most
cursed roguy Bawdy-house. Hell fire it.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; This is the worst I heard yet; Will you go home?
I'll bear you company, and give you the best help I may:
this being here will wrong you.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; As you are a Gentleman, and as you lov'd your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
dead friend, let me not go home, that will but heap one
sorrow on another.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Why <a name="p342_3" id="p342_3" class="fc">propose</a> any thing and I'll perform't; I am
at my wits end too.</p>

<p><i>Ser.</i> &nbsp; So am I, O my dear Master!</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Peace you great fool.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Then good Sir carry me to some retir'd place, far
from the sight of this unhappy City, whether you will indeed,
so it be far enough.</p>

<p>

go home,<br />
And try what may be done yet, he may be at home afore
you, Who can tell?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; O no, I know he's dead, I know he's murder'd;
tell me not of going home, you murder me too.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Well, since it pleases you to have it so, I will no
more perswade you to go home, I'll be your guide in the
Countrey, as your grief doth command me, I have a Mother
dwelling from this place some 20 miles: the house though
homely, yet able to shew something like a welcome; thither
I'll see you safe with all your sorrows.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; With all the speed that may be thought upon; I
have a Coach here ready, good Sir quickly; I'll fit you my
fine husband.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; It shall be so; if this fellow be dead, I see no
band of any other Man, to tye me from my will, and I will
follow her with such careful service, that she shall either be
my Love, or Wife; Will you walk in?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; I thank you, Sir, but one word with my Man, and
I am ready; keep the <i>Irish</i> fellow safe, as you love your life,
for he I fear has a deep hand in this, then search agen, and get
out warrants for that naughty man, that keeps the bad house,
that he may answer it, if you find the body, give it due burial;

<p><i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; Pray what is love? for I am full of that I do not know.</p>

<p>
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Why, love fair Maid is an extream desire,<br />
That's not to be examin'd, but fulfill'd,<br />
To ask the reason why thou art in love,<br />
Or what might be the noblest end in love,<br />
Would overthrow that kindly rising warmth,<br />
That many times slides gently o'r the heart,<br />
'Twould make thee grave and staid, thy thoughts would be,<br />
Like a thrice married Widow, full of ends,<br />
And void of all compassion, and to fright thee<br />
From such enquiry, whereas thou art now<br />
Living in ignorance, mild, fresh, and sweet,<br />
And but sixteen; the knowing what love is,<br />
Would make thee six and forty.<br />

Scholars affirm, the <a name="p345_29" id="p345_29" class="fc">world's</a> upheld by Love,<br />

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Why, there is love in me.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; There's charity I am sure towards me.</p>

<p>
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; And love; which I will now express, my pretty maid,<br />
I dare not bring thee home, my wife is foul,<br />
And therefore envious, she is very old,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>And therefore jealous: thou art fair and young.<br />

That all the honest industry I have,<br />
Deserves brown bread? if this may be endur'd<br />
She'll pick a quarrel with a sleeping child,<br />
E'r she fall out with me.<br />

<p><i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; How fell you in love with such a creature?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; I never lov'd her.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; And yet married her?</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; She was a rich one.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; And you swore I warrant you, she was a fair one then too.</p>

<p><i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Or believe me, I think I had not had her.</p>

<p>
<i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; Are you men all such? wou'd you wou'd wall us in a place<br />
Where all we women that are innocent,<br />
Might live together.<br />
<br />
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Do not weep at this,<br />
Although I dare not for some weighty reason<br />
Displease my Wife, yet I forget not thee.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; What will you do with me?</p>

<p>
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Thou shalt be plac'd<br />
At my mans house, and have such food and raiment<br />
As can be bought with money: these white hands<br />
Shall never learn to work, but they shall play<br />
As thou say'st they were wont, teaching the strings<br />
To move in order, or what else thou wilt.<br />
<br />
<i>Vio.</i> &nbsp; I thank you, Sir, but pray you cloath me poorly,<br />
And let my labor get me means to live.<br />

I do not use to have such language given<br />
Within my doors to me; for your wench,<br />
You may go seek her with more patience,<br />
She's tame enough, I warrant you.<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; Pray forgive me.<br />
I do confess my much forgetfulness;<br />
And weigh my words no farther, I beseech you,<br />
Then a mere madness, for such a grief has seiz'd me<br />
So strong and deadly, as a punishment,<br />
And a just one too,<br />
That 'tis a greater wonder I am living,<br />
Than any thing I utter; yet let me tell you thus much,<br />
'Twas a fault for leaving her<br />
So in the fields.<br />
<br />
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Sir, I will think so now, and credit me,<br />
You have so wrought me with your grief, that I<br />
Do both forgive and pity you:<br />
And if you'll please to take a bed this night here;<br />
To morrow I'll bring you where I left her.<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; I thank you, <a name="p351_21" id="p351_21" class="fc">[no,]</a> shall I be so unworthy:<br />
To think upon a bed, or ease, or comfort,<br />
And have my heart stray from me, God knows where,<br />
Cold and forsaken, destitute of friends,<br />
And all good comforts else, unless some tree<br />
Whose speechless charity must better ours,<br />
With which the bitter east winds made their sport<br />
And sung through hourly, hath invited her<br />
To keep off half a day? shall she be thus,<br />
And I draw in soft slumbers? <i>God</i> forbid.<br />
No, night and bitter coldness, I provoke thee,<br />
And all the dews that hang upon thy locks,<br />
Showrs, Hails, Snows, Frosts, and two edged Winds that prime<br />
The maiden blossoms, I provoke you all,<br />
And dare expose this body to your sharpness,<br />
Till I be made a Land-mark.<br />
<br />
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Will you then stay and eat with me?<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; Y'are angry with me, I know y'are angry,<br />
You would not bid me eat else; my poor Mistriss,<br />

Think not ill manners in me for denying<br />
Your offer'd meat, for sure I cannot eat<br />

I pray you do not, if you love me do not.<br />

Nor let me see<br />
None Sir, if you love heaven;<br />

<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; I hate drink, there's the end on't,<br />
And that man that drinks with meat is damn'd<br />
Without an age of prayers and repentance,<br />
And there's a hazard too; good Sir, no more<br />
If you will do me a free courtesie;<br />
That I shall know for one: go take your horse,<br />
And bring me to the place where you left her:<br />
<br />

Upon my credit you shall see no drink.<br />

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Whence comes it do you say?</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; Sir from the City.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Oh from the City, 'tis a reverent place.</p>

<p>
<i>Curio.</i> &nbsp; And his justice be as short as his memory,<br />
A Dudgion Dagger will serve him to mow down sin withal,<br />
What clod-pole Commissioner is this?<br />
<br />
<i>Just.</i> &nbsp; And by my faith, govern'd by worthy members,<br />
Discreet and upright.<br />

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; Sir, they are beholding to you, you have given some

Your Letter.</p>

<p>
<i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; Pray do Sir; what a misery 'tis<br />
To have an urgent business wait the Justice<br />
Of such an old Tuff-taffata that knows not,<br />
Nor can be brought to understand more sence,<br />
Than how to restore supprest Alehouses,<br />
And have his man compound small trespasses,<br />
For ten groats.<br />

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis for mine own ease I'll assure your Worship.</p>

<p>
<i>Just.</i> &nbsp; It shall not be i' faith friend, here I have it,<br />
That one <i>Antonio</i> a Gentleman, I take it so,<br />
Yes, it is so, a Gentleman is lately thought to<br />
Have been made away, and by my faith, upon a<br />
Pearls ground too, if you consider; well, there's<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>Knavery in't, I see that without spectacles.</p>

<p>
<i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; Sure this fellow deals in revelation, he's so hidden,<br />
Goe thy ways, thou wilt stick a bench spit as formally,<br />
And shew thy Agot, and hatch'd chain<br />

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; And now I have consider'd, I believe it.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; What Sir?</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; That he was murdered.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; Did you know him?</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; No.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; Nor how it is suppos'd.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; No, nor I care not two-pence, those are toys and
yet I verily believe he was murdered, as sure as I believe
thou art a man, I never fail'd in these things yet, w'are a
man that's beaten to these matters, experience is a certain
conceal'd thing that fails not: pray let me ask you one
thing, why do you come to me?</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; Because the Letter is addrest to you, being the
nearest Justice.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; The nearest? is that all?</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; I think it be Sir, I would be loth you should be
the wisest.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Well Sir, as it is, I will endeavour in it; yet if
it had come to me by name, I know not, but I think it had
been as soon dispatcht as by another, and with as round a
wisdom, I, and as happily, but that's all one: I have born
this place this thirty years, and upwards, and with sufficient
credit, and they may when they please, know me better;
to the nearest? well.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; Sir, it is not my fault, for had I known you
sooner&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; I thank you Sir, I know it.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; I'll be sworn you should have plaid <a name="p364_32" id="p364_32" class="fc">for [any]</a>
business now.</p>

<p>
<i>Just.</i> &nbsp; And further, they have specified unto me, his
Wife is sorely suspected in this matter, as a main cause.
</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; I think she be Sir, for no other cause can be yet
found.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; And one <i>Mercury</i> a traveller, with whom they say
directly she is run away, and as they think this way.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; I knew all this before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Well Sir, this <i>Mercury</i> I know, and his breeding,
a neighbors child hard by, you have been happy, Sir, in
coming hither.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; Then you know where to have him, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; I do Sir, he dwells near me.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; I doubt your Worship dwels near a knave then.</p>

<p>
<i>Just.</i> &nbsp; I think so; pray put on: but 'tis a wonder<br />
To see how graceless people are now given,<br />
And how base virtue is accounted with them<br />
That should be all in all, as says a wise man.<br />
<br />
I tell you Sir, and it is true, that there have been such
murthers, and of late days, as 'twould make your very heart
bleed in you, and some of them as I shall be enabled, I will
tell you, it fell out of late days.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; It may be so, but will it please you to proceed in this?</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; An honest Weaver, and as good a workman, as
e'er shot shuttle, and as close: but every man must dye; this
honest Weaver being a little mellow in his Ale, that was
the evidence <i>verbatim</i>, Sir, God bless the mark, sprung his
neck just in this place: well <i>Jarvis</i>, thou hadst wrongs, and
if <a name="p365_21" id="p365_21" class="fc">I</a> live some of the best shall sweat for't, then a wench&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; But Sir, you have forgot my business.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; A sober pretty maid about 17, they say, certainly,
howsoever 'tis shuffled, she burst her self, and fondly, if it
be so, with Furmety at a Churching, but I think the Devil
had another agent in't: either of which, if I can catch, shall
stretch for't.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Valerio, <i>and</i> Richardo.</p>

<p>
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; This is the place; here did I leave the Maid<br />
Alone last night, drying her tender eyes,<br />
Uncertain what to do, and yet desirous<br />
To have me gone.<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; How rude are all we men,<br />
That take the name of <i>Civil</i> to our selves!<br />
If she had set her foot upon an earth<br />
Where people live that we call barbarous;<br />
Though they had had no house to bring her to,<br />
They would have spoil'd the glory, that the spring<br />
Has deckt the trees in, and with willing hands<br />
Have torn their branches down, and every man<br />
Would have become a builder for her sake.<br />
What time left you her there?<br />
<br />
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; I left her, when the Sun had so much to sett,<br />
As he is now got from his place of rise.<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; So near the night she could not wander far;<br />
Fair <i>Viola</i>!<br />
<br />
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; It is in vain to call, she sought a house<br />
Without all question.<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; Peace, fair <i>Viola</i>?<br />
Fair <i>Viola</i>? who should have left her here<br />
On such a ground? if you had meant to lose her,<br />
You might have found there were <a name="p366_35" id="p366_35" class="fc">no ecchos</a> here<br />
To take her name, and carry it about,<br />
When her true Lover came to mourn for her,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>Till all the neighboring valleys and the hills,<br />
Resounded <i>Viola</i>,&mdash;<br />
And such a place,<br />
You should have chose&mdash;<br />
You pity us because<br />
The dew a little wets our feet,<br />
Unworthy far to seek her in the wet;<br />
And what becomes of her? where wandred she,<br />
With two showers raining on her, from her eyes<br />
Continually, abundantly, from which<br />
There's neither tree nor house to shelter her;<br />
Will you go with me to travel?<br />
<br />
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Whither?<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; Over all the world.<br />
<br />
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; No by my faith, I'll make a shorter journey<br />
When I do travel.<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; But there's no hope<br />
To gain my end in any shorter way.<br />
<br />
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Why, what's your end?<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; It is to search the earth,<br />
Till we have found two in the shapes of men,<br />
As wicked as our selves.<br />
<br />
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; 'Twere not so hard to find out those.<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; Why, if we find them out,<br />
It were the better, for what brave villany,<br />
Might we four do? we wou'd not keep together:<br />
For every one has treachery enough<br />
For twenty countreys, one should trouble <i>Asia</i>,<br />
Another should sow strife in <i>Africa</i>;<br />
But you should play the knave, in at home in <i>Europe</i>,<br />
And for <i>America</i> let me alone.<br />
<br />
<i>Val.</i> &nbsp; Sir, I am honester,<br />
Than you know how to be, and can no more<br />
Be wrong'd, but I shall find my self aright.<br />
<br />
<i>Rich.</i> &nbsp; If you had any spark of honesty,<br />
You would not think that honester than I,<br />
Were a praise high enough to serve your turn:<br />
If men were commonly so bad as I,<br />
Thieves would be put in Calendars for Saints;<br />
And bones of murderers would work miracles.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>I am a kind of knave, of knave so much<br />

<p><i>Moth.</i> &nbsp; <i>Melvia?</i> It cannot be, fool, alas you know she

last, lay in <i>Antonio's</i> house, and in the night he rose, raising
<i>Antonio</i>, where privately they were in talk an hour, to what
end I know not: but of likelyhood, finding <i>Antonio's</i> house
not a fit place to murder him in, he suffered him to go to
bed again, but in the morning early, he train'd him I think
forth, after which time he never saw his home; his cloaths
were found near the place where <i>Mercury</i> was, and the people
at first denyed they saw him: but at last he made a <a name="p374_24" id="p374_24" class="fc">friv[o]lous</a>
tale, that there he shifted himself into a Footmans habit:
but in short, the next hour this woman went to <i>Mercury</i>, and
in her Coach they posted hither; true accusations, I have no
more, and I will make none.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Whether you are or no, confess, it will be the
better for you.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; If I were guilty, your Rhetorick could not fetch
it forth: but though I am innocent, I confess, that if I
were a stander by, these <a name="p374_37" id="p374_37" class="fc">circ[u]mstances</a> urg'd, which are true,
would make me doubtless believe the accused parties, to be

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Write down, that he being a stander by; for so

which is himself to be guilty.</p>

what say you to this, are not you guilty?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; No, as I hope for mercy.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; But are not those circumstances true, that this
Gentleman hath so shortly and methodically deliver'd?</p>

<p>
<i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; They are, and what you do with me, I care not,<br />
Since he is dead, in whom was all my care:<br />
You knew him not.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; No, an't been better for you too, and you had
never known him.</p>

<p>
<i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Why then you did not know the worlds chief joy,<br />
His face so manly as it had been made,<br />
To fright the world, yet he so sweetly temper'd;<br />
That he would make himself a natural fool,<br />
To do a noble <a name="p375_26" id="p375_26" class="fc">kind[n]ess</a> for a friend.<br />
He was a man whose name I'll not out-live,<br />
Longer than heaven, whose Will must be obey'd;<br />
Will have me do.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; And I will quit thy kindness.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Before me, she has made the tears stand in mine
eyes, but I must be austere, Gentlewoman; you must confess
this murder.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; I cannot, Sir, I did it not, but I desire to see those
examinations which this Gentleman acknowledges to have
about him, for but late last night I receiv'd Letters from
the City, yet I heard of no confession, then.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; You shall see them time enough I warrant you, but
Letters you say you had, where are those Letters?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Sir, they are gone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Gone? whither are they gone?<br />
How have you dispos'd of 'em?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Why Sir, they are for womens matters, and so I
use 'em.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Who writ 'em?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; A man of mine.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Who brought 'em?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; A Post.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; A Post? there is some great haste sure, aha, where
is that Post?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Sir, there he stands..</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Does he so? bring hither that Post, I am afraid that
Post will prove a knave; come hither Post, what? what can
you say concerning the murder of <i>Antonio</i>?</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; What's that to you?</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Oh Post, you have no answer ready, have you? I'll
have one from you.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; You shall have no more from me than you have;
you examine an honest Gentleman and Gentlewoman here,
'tis pitty such fools as you should be i'th Commission.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Say you so Post, take away that Post, whip him
and bring him again quickly, I'll hamper you Post.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; 'Tis <i>Antonio</i>, I know him now as well; what an
irregular fool is this!</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; Whip me? hold off.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Oh good Sir whip him, by his murmuring he should
know something of my Husbands death; that may quit me,
for gods sake fetch't out.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Whip him I say.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; Who is't dares whip me now?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> &nbsp; Oh my lov'd Husband.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; My most worthy friend? where have you been so
long?</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; I cannot speak for joy.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; Why, what's the matter now, and shall not Law
then have her course?</p>

<p><i>Andra.</i> &nbsp; It shall <a name="p376_37" id="p376_37" class="fc">h[a]ve</a> no other course than it has I think.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; It shall have other course before I go, or I'll beat
my brains, and I say it was not honestly done of him to
discover himself before the parties accus'd were executed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
that Law might have had her course, for then the kingdom
flourishes.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; But such a wife as thou, had never any man, and
such a friend as he, believe me wife, shall never be <a name="p377_4" id="p377_4" class="fc">[a]</a> good
wife, love my friend, friend love my wife, hark friend.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; <i>Mark</i>, if we can have nothing to do, you shall swear
the peace of some body.</p>

<p><i>Mark.</i> &nbsp; Yes Sir.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; By my troth I am sorry my wife is so obstinate,
sooth, if I could yet do thee any good, I wou'd, faith I
wou'd.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; I thank you Sir, I have lost that passion.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; Cosin <i>Curio</i>, you and I must be better acquainted.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; It is my wish, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> &nbsp; I should not have known you neither, 'tis so long
since we saw, we were but children then: but you have
shew'd your self an honest man to me.</p>

<p><i>Cur.</i> &nbsp; I would be ever so.</p>

nothing, but if it doth cost him any thing, I'll pay it.</p>

<p><i>Just.</i> &nbsp; <i>Mark</i>, up with your papers, away.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> &nbsp; Oh you shall stay dinner, I have a couple of brawling
neighbors, that I'll assure you will not agree, and you shall

But such an overswayed Sex is yours,<br />
That all the virtuous actions you can do,<br />

<p>It has not been thought necessary to record the correction of every turned
letter nor the substitution of marks of interrogation for marks of exclamation
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Full-stops have been silently inserted at the ends of speeches
and each fresh speaker has been given the dignity of a fresh line: in the
double-columned folio the speeches are frequently run on. Misprints in the
Quartos and the First Folio are recorded when they appear to be interesting.
A word or two from the printed text is attached to the variants recorded below
in cases where the variant, by itself, would not be sufficiently clear. Altered
punctuation is shown, usually, by printing the old punctuation between the
preceding and following words.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
